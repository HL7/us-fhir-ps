## US Variance to IPS

The US-PCS attempts to strongly align with the IPS but it does not derive its Bundle or Composition profiles from the IPS. All 16 sections of the IPS are profiled in US-PCS, but resource expectations draw primarily from US Core rather than IPS clinical profiles. 

### US Variance in Must Support, Obligation and Actors

The US-PCS guide does not use the Must Support definition through obligations as defined in the [IPS Implementation Guide](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/STU2/Must-Support-and-Obligations.html). In addition, the [Must Support definition](./general-guidance.html#must-support-definition) in US-PCS for Document Creator and Document Consumer behavior vary from the IPS Actor Definition of [IPS Creator](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/ActorDefinition-Creator.html) and [IPS Consumer](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/ActorDefinition-Consumer.html).
